C++ supports multiple inheritance.			<->			Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through class. It can be achieved by interfaces in java.

==============Java Constructor=====================												=====================Java Method================
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.										A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.														A method must have a return type.
The constructor is invoked implicitly.															The method is invoked explicitly.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.	The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.											The method name may or may not be same as the class name.

Q) Does constructor return any value?
Yes, it is the current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).
Q) Can constructor perform other tasks instead of initialization?
Yes, like object creation, starting a thread, calling a method, etc. You can perform any operation in the constructor as you perform in the method.
Q) Is there Constructor class in Java?
Yes.
Q) What is the purpose of Constructor class?
Java provides a Constructor class which can be used to get the internal information of a constructor in the class. It is found in the java.lang.reflect package.
