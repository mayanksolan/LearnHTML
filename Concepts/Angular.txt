Circle of execution of Angular project - 

1. main.ts file gets started 
2. we bootstrap an Angular application and we pass this module as an argument. 
	->	In main.ts we have - import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
3. In this module, we tell Angular, hey there is this app component which you know when you try to start yourself 
	-> in app.module.ts we have - import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
4. Angular now analyzes the app component, reads the set up we pass here and therefore knows this selector, app-root
	-> in app.component.ts - @Component({
								selector: 'app-root',
								templateUrl: './app.component.html',
								styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
							})
4. Angular is able to handle app-root in the index.html file and it knows
	->	<app-root></app-root>
